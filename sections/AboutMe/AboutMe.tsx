      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm John Williams, a composer, conductor, and pianist with a
        career spanning over six decades. I've had the privilege of creating
        music for some of the most beloved films in cinematic history, including
        "Star Wars," "Jaws," "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," "Indiana Jones," and
        "Harry Potter." My passion lies in crafting scores that elevate
        storytelling, bringing characters and worlds to life through music.
